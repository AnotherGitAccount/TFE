# Mask Drawer

This tool allows you to easily create masks. They are saved as binary files to be directly usable 
with the beta-utils tool.

## Installation

1. Add tkinter to you python modules
2. Get the files of this repo

## Usage

Execute `./python3 drawer <file_name>`. Where file_name is the file to edit (it is created if it
doesn't exist). Note that the file_name doesn't include the file extension. The file will 
automaticaly be saved with the .bin extension.

Example: `./python3 drawer mask` will edit `mask.bin`.
