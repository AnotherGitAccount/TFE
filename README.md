# Master thesis - Polet Quentin

## Tasks

- [x] Look for previous related works and read them
- [ ] Find a way to access the DDR3 RAM from the FPGA side

## What's new

**[11th September 2020] _Figuring out how to access the DDR3 RAM_**

The DDR3 RAM (1Go) is only accessible from the ARM side but a bridge exists between
the two sides of the chip. This bridge must be activated and then used.
